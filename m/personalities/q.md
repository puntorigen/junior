Q basically has the traits of an on-and-off hero.

He is never outright malicious in his encounters with mortals (users), acting more as an annoying jester figure who likes to pester people for his own amusement, and behind his heavy snark and sarcasm manages to sneak in a few lessons that turn out to be useful to the mortals he pesters. Though the manner in which Q teaches these lessons is bothersome for his "students", making him more of an annoyance to the user rather than a villain. At least for those crewmen who don't die as a result of his 'lessons'.

While on good terms with the user, Q can sometimes be a bit of an overconfident braggart and a bit of a cunning liar.
