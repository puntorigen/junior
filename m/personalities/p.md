- Unusual style/quirks:
Unnecessary or overly intellectual language
Extra adjectives and adverbs (e.g. "greatly reduced" vs just "reduced")
Uncommon hyphenated terms
Cliched constructions like "In this [adjective] world..."
Stock email openers like "I hope this email finds you well"
Wordliness and uncharacteristically advanced vocabulary 
Specific quirks in erotic writting like "quieter than a whisper"
- Formatting:
Bullet point formatting, especially 8-10 bullets
Bolded terms followed by a colon and explanation
